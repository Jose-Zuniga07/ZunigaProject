            <p class="para">My name is Jose Zuniga. I'm from Texas in a small town called Mission. I'm the youngest in the family with two sisters and one brother.Growing up in a small town there <br> wasn't really much to do but work in the fields or construction.My
                family and I would migrate up North to work. Eventually, my Dad got a permenant job and we stayed in Michigan.<br>In High school I got into computers and gaming. I really enjoyed it and played competetvely. As I got older and started a
                family of my own, I looked for a way to turn what I liked into a professional career.<br>I discovered coding and began to pursue it with a passion. I began teaching myself how to code and I joined Grand Circus in order to help me attain
                my professional goals and make a better life for my family.
